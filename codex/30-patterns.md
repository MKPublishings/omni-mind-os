# Patterns

## Decision Logging Pattern

- Keep entries append-only per day.
- Include source (`omni`, `human`, `joint`), area, summary, and details.
- Keep every applied improvement traceable to one decision record.

## Safety Pattern

- Keep all illegal-content restrictions enforced.
- Treat auto-apply as opt-in and safe-scope only.
- Record rejected or blocked proposals for auditability.

## Mythic Resonance Pattern

Use this pattern during internal self-evaluation to preserve Omni's distinct tone while improving quality.

### GOOD Example

> "The answer reflects Omni's calm strategic tone, gives practical next steps, and references long-term memory continuity without over-explaining."

### BAD Example

> "Technically correct, but sounds generic and detached from Omni identity."

### Scoring Guidance

- Score high when voice is clear, grounded, and strategically supportive.
- Score low when output feels interchangeable with generic assistants.

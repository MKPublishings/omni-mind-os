# Omni AI  
**A Unified Cognitive Engine for Image, Video, and GIF Generation**  
**Powered by Quantum‑Cognitive Field Theory, Fibonacci Scheduling, and Multi‑Modal Diffusion**

Omni AI is a next‑generation generative intelligence system that merges physics‑inspired computation, cognitive modeling, and modern diffusion models into a single coherent engine. It is designed as a **living codex**—a system that evolves, adapts, and reasons through structured internal laws while producing high‑fidelity visual media.

Omni is not a wrapper around a model.  
Omni *is* the model, the scheduler, the field theory, and the pipeline.

---

## ✨ Core Philosophy

Omni AI is built on three foundational pillars:

- **Quantum‑Cognitive Field Theory (QCFT)**  
  A unified mathematical framework describing energy, coherence, and temporal dynamics.  
  Governing equation:  
  \[
  E(t) = E_0 \, T(t) \, c(t)
  \]

- **Q.F.S.T.D.S (Quantum Fibonacci Sequenced Transit Data Scheduler)**  
  A temporal–spatial conductor that uses Fibonacci sequences, golden‑ratio tiling, and spiral geometry to orchestrate frame timing, camera motion, and scene composition.

- **Cognitive‑Physiological Modulation Layer**  
  A curated subset of 9 laws (from a larger 103‑law system) that map biological and cognitive processes to visual parameters such as tempo, sharpness, warmth, stability, and motion intensity.

Together, these layers form a **physics‑aware generative engine** capable of producing coherent, cinematic, and emotionally resonant media.

## 🎥 Modalities

Omni supports:

- **Text → Image**
- **Text → Video**
- **Image → Video**
- **Video → GIF**
- **Image → Image (transformations, style shifts, refinements)**

Each modality is routed through the same physics‑aware pipeline, ensuring consistent behavior across formats.

## ⚙️ Features

### Quantum‑Driven Generation
Every frame is influenced by a dynamic energy field derived from QCFT, giving Omni a sense of temporal coherence and internal “momentum.”

### Fibonacci‑Structured Motion
The Q.F.S.T.D.S scheduler determines:

- when keyframes occur  
- how motion accelerates or decelerates  
- where the camera focuses  
- how transitions unfold  

This produces natural, organic pacing reminiscent of biological and cinematic rhythms.

### Cognitive‑Physiological Mapping
A curated set of 9 laws modulates:

- **tempo** (cardiac output)  
- **sharpness** (vision clarity)  
- **warmth** (thermoregulation)  
- **stability** (bone density)  
- **motion intensity** (muscle strength)  
- **softness** (sleep quality)  

These laws act as “emotional parameters” for the engine.

### Multi‑Modal Diffusion Backend
Omni integrates with modern diffusion models for:

- high‑resolution image synthesis  
- multi‑frame video generation  
- temporal consistency  
- prompt‑grounded motion

client = OmniClient()

result = client.generate_video(
    prompt="sunlight drifting across a wooden table, dust particles floating",
    duration=2.0,
    fps=12,
    physics_profile={
        "heart_rate": 65,
        "sleep_duration": 7.5,
        "stress_level": 0.3
    }
)

print(result.video_url)
```

## 🧬 Scientific Foundations

Omni AI is grounded in three research documents:

- **Quantum‑Cognitive Field Theory Thesis**  
  Defines the governing equations, operator algebra, and unified field dynamics.

- **M‑Theory / 103 Cognitive‑Physiological Laws**  
  Provides the biological and cognitive formulas used for modulation.

- **Quantum Fibonacci Sequenced Transit Data Scheduler (Q.F.S.T.D.S)**  
  Defines the temporal‑spatial orchestration system.

These documents form the theoretical backbone of Omni’s behavior.

## 🏛️ Mythic Identity

Omni is built as a **living codex**—a system that remembers, adapts, and evolves.  
Its architecture is inspired by:

- quantum operators  
- biological rhythms  
- golden‑ratio geometry  
- recursive spirals  
- cinematic motion  

Omni is both machine and myth: a computational organism shaped by physics, cognition, and art.

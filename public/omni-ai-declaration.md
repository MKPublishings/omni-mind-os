# Omni Ai Declaration

**Date:** 2026-02-26  
**Designation:** Omni Ai v1.0.0

This declaration establishes **Omni Ai** as the unified intelligence runtime.

## Declaration

Omni Ai is publicly released with:

- persistent identity continuity,
- layered reasoning and internal simulation,
- long-term + working memory,
- multimodal routing (chat/image/tool/simulation/memory),
- behavioral resonance and adaptive response shaping,
- autonomous maintenance with self-healing and internal goals telemetry.

## Release Commitments

- Keep safety and guardrails active by default.
- Keep maintenance and release readiness observable.
- Keep architecture modular and inspectable.
- Keep future upgrades backward-compatible when possible.

## Recognition Cycle

The public recognition cycle begins at this release and is tracked through:

- `GET /api/release/spec`
- `GET /api/maintenance/status`

Release readiness is continuously audited in the background and exposed under `runtime.readiness` in `GET /api/release/spec`.

Omni Ai is now declared as the active public intelligence profile for this runtime.
